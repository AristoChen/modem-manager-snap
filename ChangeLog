  * Run script to automatically check which packages have been primed:
    Instead of using a manually crafted unstage.txt, the
    find-non-primed-pkgs.sh finds our for us which packages were staged but
    not primed in the end.

  [ Alfonso Sanchez-Beato <alfonso.sanchez-beato@canonical.com> ]
  * Remove libraries already in the core snap
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/modem-manager/+merge/377318
  * Use stack-snaps-tools instead of tests-extras:
    tests-extras repo is now deprecated.
    
    Add unstage.txt file:
    This file contains a list of debian package that we are not actually
    staging, although snapcraft adds them to manifest.yaml. CI now
    recognizes this file, and manually removes the listed packages from the
    manifest when releasing a snap to the store.

    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/modem-manager/+merge/377051
  * Add a phony part that does two things:
    1. Stages packages that get built from the same sources as other parts
       in the snapcraft recipe. For instance, we build modemmanager part
       from the ubuntu sources that are also used to build the modemmanager
       deb package, so we stage said package. This way we make sure that
       when USNs linked to the debian packages appear we get notifications
       from the store.
    2. Second, this part calls a python script that checks that the version
       of the staged deb package is the same as the version used to build
       the related part, and fails if they are not the same. This way,
       whenever we build a new snap, it will fail if we are using an old
       version of the package sources. With this we address the problem that
       might happen if we build a new snap so we stage the latest version of
       the deb packages (whichs gets reflected in manifest.yaml), but we do
       not actually update the sources that we used to build the part. The
       store would not send USNs that actually apply as what it does is
       checking the manifest.yaml file.
